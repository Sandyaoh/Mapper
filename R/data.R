#' Subset of World Values Survey
#' 
#' This data set contains a small subset of Wave 6 of the World Values Survey. The subset is 
#' specifically only responses collected in the U.S., and contains a fraction of the dimensions, 
#' which were renamed to more semantically clearer names.
#' 
#' The dimensions correspond the following question codes (in order):
#' V4, V5, V7, V8, V9, V10, V11, V23, V24, V25, V29, V30, V32, V55, V56, V57, V58, V59, V60, 
#' V61, V67, V68, V69, V84, V95, V97, V98, V101
#' 
#' Please refer to the WV6 codebook for more details on the questions and responses.
