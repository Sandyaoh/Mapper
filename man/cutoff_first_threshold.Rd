\usage{
cutoff_first_threshold(hcl, threshold = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{hcl}{hierarchical clustering in the form an 'hclust' object.}

\item{threshold}{density threshold.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to \code{\link[stats]{density}}.}
}
\description{
Uses a heuristic similar to the one described in Section 3.1 of the original Mapper paper to cut a given hierarchical tree to produce a partitioning of the data.
}
\details{
The cut value is chosen as the lowest (interpolated) height value where the density of linkage distances is lower than or equal to 
a given threshold value. Note that while this method offers a smooth alternative to \code{\link{cutoff_first_bin}} and may provide empirically better 
clusterings, it's noticeably slower due to the call the \code{\link[stats]{density}}.
