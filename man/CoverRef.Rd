\description{
Reference Class (R6) implementation of a Cover. This class is meant to act as an abstract class to derive other 
types of covering generators with. Minimally, a derived covering class must implement the
'construct_cover' method to populate the 'level_sets' list with point indices, and any parameters 
that the derived class requires. 

Additional methods may also be added to improve the efficiency of the cover. 
See the \href{https://peekxc.github.io/Mapper/articles/UsingCustomCover.html}{vignette} on creating a custom 
cover for details.

\section{Fields}{

The following is a list of the fields available for derived classes. Each may be accessed 
by the \code{self} environment. See \code{?R6} for more details. 
\itemize{
 \item{\emph{level_sets}:}{ named list, indexed by \code{index_set}, whose values represent indices in the original data set to cluster over.}
 \item{\emph{index_set}:}{ character vector of keys that uniquely index the open sets of the cover.}
 \item{\emph{typename}:}{ unique string identifier identifying the covering method.}
}
