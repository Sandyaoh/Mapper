\description{
This function implements the discrete, extended version of gromov hausdorff distance proposed by 
Memoli in section 7 of (1) for comparing two measure-metric spaces.
}
\details{
This function provides an implementation of the computational objective \emph{(Pp)} listed in Section 7 of (1), which 
calculates an Lp approximition of Gromov-Hausdorff (i.e. wasserstein relaxation) distance between two measure-metric spaces. The first lower bound (FLB)
is first computed via an LOP, and then the solution is used as the initialization point for the corresponding quadratic optimization 
routine. This code utilizes the \emph{R Optimization Infrastructure}(\pkg{ROI}), and relies on having available at least one plugin 
available for to solve the initial lower bound (a linear program) and the final optimization (cast as a generic nonlinear optimization). 
Both solutions are returned to the user, unless \code{flb_only} is set to true, in which case only the FLB is returned. 

\strong{NOTE:} The primary quadratic optimization problem (QOP) is non-convex, and requires solving for (n^2 x m^2) variables.
Thus, the function may be very computationally expensive to run. The FLB is an LOP of the same size.
