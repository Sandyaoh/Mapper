\description{
This function implements the discrete, extended version of gromov hausdorff distance proposed by 
Memoli in section 7 of (1) for comparing two measure-metric spaces.
}
\details{
This function provides an implementation of the computational objective \emph{(Pp)} listed in Section 7 of (1), which 
calculates an Lp approximition of Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two measure-metric spaces. The first lower bound (FLB)
is first computed via an LOP, and then the solution is handed off as the starting point to the corresponding nonlinear optimization 
routine. This code utilizes the \emph{R Optimization Infrastructure}(\pkg{ROI}), and relies on having available at least one plugin 
available for to solve the initial lower bound (a linear program) and the final optimization (cast as a generic nonlinear optimization). 
See examples.
